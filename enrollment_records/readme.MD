## In this folder

Digitized enrollment records were obtained from the National Archives and its regional offices.

Most of the enrollment files obtained by the Post have been soted into their corresponding school folders in this repo but the remaining ones are in this overflow folder because 1) there were multiple schools in one file or 2) a folder did not exist for this file.

A folder of pages pulled from within individual enrollment Superintendents' Annual Narrative and Statistical Reports, [1910â€“1935](https://catalog.archives.gov/id/2049908) have also been made available.

The Post attempted to extract as many names from these enrollment pages and put them into into standardized spreadsheets for more efficient matching with names recorded in FindAGrave records. But many files remain un-OCRed. And scores of other enlistment records have yet to be processed and uploaded by the National Archives.
