consisted of an unrepaired set of Army quarters, a part of the room
being very poorly lighted, and there being insufficient facilities

of the hospital, but we were able to have a physician only on call
from Gallup. This arrangement was not satisfactory. By all means,
we should have a regular physician the coming year. This position
has not yet been allowed. ... Toward the end of the school term we were able to move into the
regular hospital which had been repaired, but since there was almost
no sickness, and the temporary nurse was anxious to be felieved, we
abandoned the use of the hospital, which will be opened again
about the middle of August, or as soon as a nurse is appointed.

I should say, on the whole, that we were not equipped to take adequate
care of our pupils, but did the best we could under the circumstances.""",,,333,,typhoid,Infectious disease,,,,,,,,
